## Getting Started

This application demonstrates merge sort algorithm to sort a list of integers 
Sorting process is made more efficient by dividing array into a smaller arrays, and then sorting and merging them together.


## Folder Structure
```
src/ 
|-- definition/ 
    |-- MergeSort.java 
|-- App.java 
/lib/ 
/bin/ 
.vscode/ 
    |-- settings.json 
    
```


The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies (no additional dependencies in this test case)

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Visual Studio Code Integration: 
This project includes a .vscode/settings.json file, which contains predefined configurations for the file structure. 
Changes made to this file will automatically generate a new structure, ensuring a consistent development environment within Visual Studio Code. 
It is recommended to review and adjust these settings as per your project requirements.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Using the Application
The App.java application demonstrates the use of the MergeSort function.
You can make changes in the App.java file to test different functionalities.
Open terminal 
cd to lib folder, 
run command 
java app
