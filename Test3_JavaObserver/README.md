## Getting Started

This application demonstrates how to create a list of objects that can be used as listeners. Also manage the list elements. 



## Folder Structure
```
src/ 
|-- definition/ 
    |-- ConcreteObserver.java 
    |-- Observer.java 
    |-- Subject.java 
|-- App.java 
/lib/ 
/bin/ 
.vscode/ 
    |-- settings.json 
    
```


The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies (no additional dependencies in this test case)

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Visual Studio Code Integration: 
This project includes a .vscode/settings.json file, which contains predefined configurations for the file structure. 
Changes made to this file will automatically generate a new structure, ensuring a consistent development environment within Visual Studio Code. 
It is recommended to review and adjust these settings as per your project requirements.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Using the Application
The App.java application demonstrates the use of object list.
You can make changes in the App.java file to test different functionalities.
Open terminal 
cd to lib folder, 
run command 
java app
